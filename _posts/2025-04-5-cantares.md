title: 'The Cantares Mexicanos at the Library of Congress'
---


I have been invited to participate in the workshop “The Cantares Mexicanos: Ancient Indigenous Song Lyrics at the Library of Congress,” convened by Camilla Townsend, Jay I. Kislak Chair for the Study of the History and Cultures of the Early Americas. 

This year’s Kislak Workshop will bring together leading experts on the sixteenth-century collection of Nahua (Aztec) songs known as the Cantares mexicanos. My work on the Cantares has appeared in *Colonial Latin American Review* and *Hispanic American Historical Review*, and I'm currently working on a book manuscript entitled “A New String for the Mexican Lyre: The Literary Discovery of Nahuatl Poetry (1826-1940),” under contract with Vanderbilt University Press.
