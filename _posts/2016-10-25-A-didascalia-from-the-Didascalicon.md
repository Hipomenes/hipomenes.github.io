I've [written before](http://hipomenes.github.io/2015/11/24/motto/) about the pleasures of knowledge according to a Roman academy and Kircher's adoption of a Platonic motto on the beauty of knowing everything. Last night, a little before falling asleep, I stumbled upon Hugh of Saint Victor's praise of *meditatio*, a practice closely related to the *lectio divina*. It is, without doubt, the most beautiful praise of intellectual work I've read, an activity that according to Hugh gives us, in Jerome Taylor's elegant translation, a "foretaste of the sweetness of eternal quiet". In *meditatio*, the rumination characteristic of the *lectio divina* is carried forth beyond the confines of the book and into the world.
