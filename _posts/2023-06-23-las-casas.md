title: Lincoln Currie presents at the Las Casas conferece
---

I'm thrilled to report that Lincoln Son Currie, my dear student and research assistant at BU, presented the paper "Seneca's Specious Prophecy and the Theology of New World Evangelization" at the international [Bartolom√© de las Casas conference](https://catholic-dominican.providence.edu/las-casas-studies-at-providence-college/las-casas-conferences/2023-las-casas-conference/) in Providence College, RI.

The paper is the fruit of several years of sustained interest in the work of the Spanish reformer.
Lincoln will begin his studies at USC Gould School of Law in Los Angeles this fall and, hopefully, will use his new knowledge and skills to advance his Lascasian research.
