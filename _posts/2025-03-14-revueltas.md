title: New article on José Revuelas
---

My new article, "Estruendos de la mirada: José Revueltas y la anamorfosis", just appeared in UNAM's *Nuevas Poligrafías: Revista de Teoría Literaria y Literatura Comparada*.

> This article proposes a study of the gaze and the vis
ible in the work of the Mexican writer José Revueltas
(1914-1976) based on an analysis of some of the most
recurrent optical devices in his narrative: convex
mirrors, the oblique gaze and the eye of the cyclops.
These “depraved perspectives” will lead, in the late
work written in confinement, to a visual device with
deep baroque roots: anamorphosis, a visual device
that requires the decentring of the point of view in
order to restore the meaning of the image. This tech
nique underlines the situated and arbitrary nature of
perception, destabilising all ideological coherence.
Far from being a mere “metaphysical impertinence,”
the aesthetics of anamorphic deformation constitutes
one of the main driving forces of Revueltas’ narrative,
by positing an irresolvable tension between the im
perative of political action and literary imagination.
Finally, the article analyses the political and aesthetic
implications of these optical devices, proposing that
anamorphosis offers a dialectical solution to the ten
sion between political commitment and fascination
with the criminal underworld. Revueltas’s oeuvre,
an unavowed heir to baroque aesthetics, destabilises
the visual field and exposes the fracture of the social
world, articulating a tragic knowledge that resists the euclidean geometries of power and ideology.
