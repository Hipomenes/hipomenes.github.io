title: Shorthand, he wrote 
---

In the December 1893 issue of *The Shorthand Review*, a diligent reader reported his discovery, while examining the historic monuments of Westminster Abbey, of a monument erected in the memory of a "competent stenographer." In the north cloister of the Abbey, the anonymous reader of the Review found a "quaint tablet", bearing a funerary inscription dedicated to William Laurence, who died in December 28, 1621, at age 29 —a tender age even for a stenographer:

>|With diligence and trvst most exemplary
>|Did William Laurence serve as Prebendary
>|And for his paines now past before not lost
>|Gain'd this remembrance at his master's costs.
>|O read these lines again; you seldome find
>|A Servant faithfvl and a master kind.

>|Shorthand he wrote; his flowre in prime did fade,
>|And hasty Dead Short-Hand of him hath made.
>|Well covld he nu'bers, and well mesur'd Land;
>|Thus doth he now that drov'ed whereon you stand,
>|Wherein he lyes so geometricall;
>|Art maketh some, but thus will Nature all.

Let's ignore, for a moment, that this is the oldest use of the word "shorthand" on record for a lost art that until then was known as tachygraphy, or the likelihood that the term arose out of the need to fit this somber joke in a verse at the expense of a young prebend beloved by his master. The image is striking, and I personally find it deeply saddening: Death as a dutiful secretary, abridging lives so save paper.
