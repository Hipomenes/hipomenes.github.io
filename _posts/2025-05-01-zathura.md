After a system crash, I took the opportunity to update my computer and  David's IRE. I'm now running [Ubuntu Sway Remix](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Sway), and it's great to have a distro that works right out of the box. In this post, that I will be editing in the next few weeks, I will keep a record of improvements, fixes and updates. The mayor upgrade (or rather simplification), is the use of ``groff`` instead of `LaTeX`, but tht might require its own post.

## Zathura

I finally figured out how to pipe `pandoc` output to `zathura`, the most beutiful PDF viewer. The command is:

```
pandoc ~/Documents/file.md --pdf-engine=pdfroff -t pdf -o - | zathura - --fork
```

This command already uses `groff` (or rather the wrapper `pdfgroff`), and while I didn't specified it, it seems to naturaly use the `ms` package. Just for the record, the following command produces a PDF **file** using `pdfroff` using the `ms` package, which was designed for writing scientific papers and is thus perfect for my needs. 

```
pandoc --citeproc --csl=/home/dhcolmenares/Documents/imprenta/chicago-note-bibliography.csl.xml  ~/Documents/test.md -t ms -o ~/Desktop/test.pdf
```

`Pandoc` has no trouble converting my `bib` bibliography and even using a custom `csl` bibligraphic style to groff.
