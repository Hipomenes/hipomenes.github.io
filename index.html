I'm <b>David Horacio Colmenares</b>, Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of California, Irvine. 
My research happens at the intersection of early modern visual studies, historical anthropology and Mesoamerican studies.

<p>I hold a PhD from the Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures at Columbia University in the City of New York and a MA in Philosophy from KU Leuven, Belgium. During 2015-2016, I was a fellow at the <a href="http://www.khi.fi.it/">Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz - Max Planck Institute's</a> <a href="http://www.khi.fi.it/CAHIM">Connecting Art Histories in the Museum</a> program. My research has also been supported by the John Carter Brown Library in Providence, RI, and Dumbarton Oaks (Harvard) in Washington DC.</p>
<p>I'm currently a member of the international research project "Itineraries Around an Artifact: the Vatican Codex 3738 and the Intellectual Spheres of the Sixteenth Century" (UNAM/La Sapienza). My publications have appeared in the Colonial Latin American Review and the Hispanic American Historical Review.</p>
