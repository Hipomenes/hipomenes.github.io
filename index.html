I'm <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">david horacio colmenares</span>, Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of California, Irvine. 
My research focuses on the intersections of early modern European antiquarianism, political theology, and hermeneutics in colonial Mexico. 
More recently, I have also turned my attention to nineteenth-century Nahua intellectuals and their all but forgotten role in shaping liberal historiography.  

<p>I hold a PhD in Latin American and Iberian Cultures from Columbia University and an MA in Philosophy from KU Leuven, Belgium. My research has also been supported by the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence, the John Carter Brown Library in Providence, RI, and Dumbarton Oaks in Washington DC.</p>
