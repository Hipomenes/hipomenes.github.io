        <strong>Teresa de Cartagena</strong> (Burgos, c.1425–?) was a Spanish writer, 
        mystic and nun who is considered to be the first Spanish 
        female writer and mystic. She became deaf between 1453 and 1459.
        Her experience of deafness influenced her two known 
        works Arboleda de los enfermos (Grove of the Infirm) and 
        Admiraçión operum Dey (Wonder at the Works of God). 
        The latter work represents what many critics consider 
        as the first feminist tract written by a Spanish woman.

        <strong>Saint Teresa of Ávila</strong> (1515–82), 
         was one of the great mystics and is a patron saint of Spain. 
         She was the foundress of the reformed, or Discalced, Carmelites. 
         She was born in Avila, in Castile, into an aristocratic family, 
         and in her childhood showed a strong religious bent. 
        Her decision to become a nun was inspired by reading the letters 
        of S. Jerome when recovering from an illness, and after gaining
        her father's unwilling consent she entered the Carmelite convent 
        of the Incarnation in 1535. From 1536 to 1539 she lived at home
        during an illness, but then returned to the cloister. 
        Her convent was of the relaxed discipline, and she began to 
        practise mental prayer. In 1555 she experienced an inner conversion 
        which profoundly changed her spiritual life.

        <strong>María de Jesús de Ágreda</strong> (1602 – 1665), was a 
        Franciscan abbess and spiritual writer, known especially 
        for her extensive correspondence with King Philip IV 
        of Spain and reports of her bilocation between Spain and New Mexico. 
        She was a noted mystic of her era. A member of the Order of the 
        Immaculate Conception, also known as Conceptionists, Mary of Jesus 
        wrote 14 books, including a series of revelations about the 
        life of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Her bilocation activity is said to 
        have occurred between her cloistered monastery in rural Spain 
        and the Jumano Indians of central New Mexico and West Texas, 
        as well as Tucson, and inspired many Franciscan missionaries 
        in the New World. In popular culture since the 17th century, 
        she has been dubbed the Lady in Blue and the Blue Nun, 
        after the color of her order's habit.

        <strong>Ursula de Jesús</strong> (1604–1668) was a Black mystic who lived in 17th century Lima, Peru, where she spent forty-three years as a slave, including twenty-eight years in the Franciscan Convent of Santa Clara. After being freed, she became a donada—a servant who took religious vows but wasn't granted full status as a nun. Beginning in 1650, her confessors ordered her to record her numerous visions, particularly of souls in purgatory, creating a diary that reveals both her spiritual experiences and everyday concerns. Though she practiced extreme physical penances typical of Spanish mystics, including wearing a hair shirt and crown of thorns while performing manual labor, her plainspoken diary articulates a theology that subtly challenged colonial Lima's racial hierarchies, particularly when she questioned whether Black women could go to heaven. Her writings navigate the complex relationship between Christian humility and self-worth in the context of slavery and racism, as she struggled to reconcile her belief in her own lowliness with her visions affirming the equal value of all souls in God's eyes.
