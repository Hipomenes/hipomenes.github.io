This is a collection of notes, minutiae, quotes and lists that are "too trifle, humble and trivial" to be worthy of a formal piece, but still worth preserving in the ether. More recently, they also include technical notes about my Linux machine (Ubuntu+ i3w) and what I call DIRE (David's Integrated Reseacrh Environment), a set of configs that create a research and writing environment centered on the use of plain text files (and the glorious Vim editor).  

This is a cyber-punk tribute to Andr√©s Henestrosa's endlessly-entertaining *Alacena de minucias*, itself a tribute to [Lizardi's *Alacena de frioleras*](/assets/alacena.png), a column that ran weekly from June 1951 to Feb 1969 in Mexico's *El Nacional*.
