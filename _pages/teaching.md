## Iberian Pathways 

All my teaching involves finding critical pathways within a broadly-defined Iberian archive---that is, the textual and visual culture produced in Spain and Colonial Latin America during the three centuries of Spanish domination, with a special focus on New Spain (Mexico). This archive includes not only the literatures of the Iberian Peninsula, but also the earliest critical discourses elicited by imperial expansion, as well as a wide range of pictographic and textual sources produced by Indigenous peoples. The pathways I seek to uncover reconnect the Iberian archive with wider currents of early modern thought, particularly philosophy and political theory. Lower division courses, organized as lectures, focus on cultural studies and visual culture. Upper division courses center on the close reading of philosophical, historical accounts, and literary texts.
