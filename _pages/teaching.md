My course 

All my teaching involves finding critical pathways within a loosely defined Iberian archive, that is, the textual and visual culture produced in the overseas territories dominated by the Habsburg empire.
My lower division courses, organized as lectures, focus on cultural studies and visual culture.
In upper division courses revolve around the close reading of philosophical and literary texts.
