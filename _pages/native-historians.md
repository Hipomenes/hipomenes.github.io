        <strong>Fernando de Alvarado Tezozomoc</strong> (c. 1525-c. 1610) This historian from Mexico-Tenochtitlan, commonly known as Tezozomoc, wrote two narratives on pre-conquest Mexico. His works, published during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, are important sources on the history of Tenochtitlan, the most important center of the so-called Aztec Empire. Although no sources exist that document Tezozomoc's formal education, his scholarly knowledge is patent in his Cronica Mexicana (c. 1598), written in Spanish. Composed of 112 chapters, in the format of a European chronicle, focuses on the rise and fall of Tenochtitlan. It creates a hybrid genre in which alphabetic writing is used to transcribe oral and pictographic ancient accounts.

        <strong>Inca Garcilaso de la Vega</strong> (1539 – 1616), born Gómez Suárez de Figueroa and known as El Inca, was a chronicler and writer born in the Viceroyalty of Peru.[1] Sailing to Spain at 21, he was educated informally there, where he lived and worked the rest of his life. The natural son of a Spanish conquistador and an Inca noblewoman born in the early years of the conquest, he is known primarily for his chronicles of Inca history, culture, and society. His work was widely read in Europe, influential and well received.[2] It was the first literature by an author born in the Americas to enter the western canon.[3]
After his father's death in 1559, Vega moved to Spain in 1561, seeking official acknowledgement as his father's son. His paternal uncle became a protector, and he lived in Spain for the rest of his life, where he wrote his histories of the Inca culture and Spanish conquest, as well as an account of De Soto's expedition in Florida.
