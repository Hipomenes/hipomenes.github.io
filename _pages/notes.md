This is a collection of notes, minutiae, quotes and book lists that are "too trifle, humble and trivial" to be worthy of a formal piece, but still worth preserving from oblivion. More recently, it also includes technical notes about my Linux machine (Ubuntu+i3w) and what I call DIRE (David's Integrated Research Environment), a set of configs and conventions that create a research and writing environment centered on the use of plain text files (and the glorious Vim editor).  

This notebook can thus be regarded as a cyber-punk tribute to Andr√©s Henestrosa's endlessly entertaining *Alacena de minucias*, itself a tribute to [Lizardi's *Alacena de frioleras*](/assets/alacena.png), a column that ran weekly from June 1951 to Feb 1969 in Mexico's *El Nacional*.
