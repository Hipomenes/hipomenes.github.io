This is a collection of notes, minutiae, quotes and [reading lists](/lecturas/). It also includes technical notes about my Linux configuration (Ubunuty+Sway) and DIRE (David's Integrated Research Environment), a set of configs and conventions, held together with glue and spare string, that work as a research and writing environment centered on the use of plain text files (and Vim).  

This notebook is a tribute to Andr√©s Henestrosa's endlessly entertaining *Alacena de minucias*, itself a tribute to Lizardi's even greater *Alacena de frioleras*.

By the way, if you're curious about my looks, I also keep a series of [recent portraits](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/2/items/losmexicanospint00mexi/losmexicanospint00mexi_jp2.zip&file=losmexicanospint00mexi_jp2/losmexicanospint00mexi_0144.jp2&id=losmexicanospint00mexi&scale=1&rotate=0).
