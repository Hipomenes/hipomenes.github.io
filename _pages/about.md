I'm **David Horacio Colmenares**, Assistant Professor of Spanish at the Department of Romance Studies in Boston University.

I graduated from the [Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures](http://laic.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. During 2015-2016, I was a fellow at the [Connecting Art Histories in the Museum](http://www.khi.fi.it/CAHIM) program, based in Berlin and run by the [Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz - Max Planck Institute](http://www.khi.fi.it/) and the [Staatliche Museen zu Berlin](http://www.smb.museum/en/home.html). During that period, my research focused on the intersections of early modern antiquarianism and Mesoamerica, by studying the networks of humanists, antiquarians and indigeneous nobilities, in places such as Seville, Madrid, Venice, Padua, Mexico City and Santo Domingo, who jointly created a Mexican antiquity through exchanges of knowledge, exegetical practices and artifacts. My dissertation, "How the Aztec got a Pantheon. The creation of an Ancient Religion in New Spain" studies the construction of a Mexican religious antiquity through the transformation of Mesoamerican *teteuh* ('deities') into pagan gods.
